Another few months, another REAio.

This time I had quite a few things going on so I wasn't able to focus on getting one major project done. In between all the meetings I had, I went around asking developers a bunch of questions on guilds and their life at REA. As a fun closing activity, I also asked them to try and draw a bicycle from memory.

Sounds easy right? Most thought so, until they started actually drawing. It's funny to think that an object so prominent and easily identifiable in society can be so hard to draw. It's made up of only a few basic shapes too.

It was very funny and I appreciated everyone having an attempt so I built this site to commemorate their efforts.
