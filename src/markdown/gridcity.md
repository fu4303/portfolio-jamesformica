2019's first UI Guild challenge: Build _something_ using CSS Grid!

I decided to build a tiny little city builder with tiles for roads, grass, sand, water and houses. All the graphics are generated using CSS. I took absolute advantage of the crazy `box-shadow` hacks to create the pixel art of the grass, sand and water. I had a crack at adding a little car that drove around the road but that was getting way too complicated so gave up on that quickly.

It was good fun and I look forward to the next challenge.
