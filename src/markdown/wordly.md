Apparently I just can't get enough of trying to create generative art...

The idea here was that you would write a narrative and it would create a bit of an artwork as you type. I was hoping it would encourage me to write but I'm not sure it will. It's completely generative so you will always get the same art if you type the same exact words cause that how I roll.

I even added a bit of `@media print` shenanigans so you could save it to a PDF or print it and it would look kinda nice. I feel this is going to be one of my least used apps, but it has one of the cleanest UIs I've made. So its got that going for it...
