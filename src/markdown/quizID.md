I have been obsessed with the idea of using REA's data and APIs for something stupid for a while. Then I stumbled across the "number neighbour" trend where people would text the phone number one digit higher or lower than theirs for fun. ðŸ’¡! Then it hit me, every property in Australia has an REA ID so I should be able to implement the same concept to help you find your property ID neighbours.

âœ… is using REA's data and APIs

âœ… is stupid

To make it a bit more fun, before showing your neighbours you first have to answer a quick quiz about them. E.g. what is their postcode/suburb/state/number of bedroom/bathrooms. There is even a little score counter with a maximum score of 1200. It all came together and is honestly one of the most polished apps I have built in a while. (its all internal so you may not be able to see it sorry)
