What happens when you bring a laptop to a conference of approximately 800 people and tell people to add whatever they wanted to a website? Chaos. Absolute chaos. Although, not as much chaos as I expected...

I was at DDD Melbourne 2019 with the JuniorDev community and we had setup our booth in the community area. Anyone who came by was asked to add to the site. The rules were as follows:

* Keep it child friendly
* No Bitcoin mining

The result it pretty hideous but in a fantastic way. We only had to undo one change which hid the cursor on the whole site. Cheeky.
