It started with a talk. A talk about React Hooks that a colleague and I were planning on giving at REA's TKO (tech kick off). So we had the talk idea, but how to make it fun? Well, what if we built a "game" using Hooks and then explain how we used them? Brilliant!

So we built "Hooked". The idea was that it would provide real-time feedback on how _hooked_ you were on a talk that is being presented to you. Put simply: the more fishies on the screen, the more hooked the audience is. Each fish disappears after 10 or so seconds so the audience needs to keep the number up.

The talked ended up being really fun (should be somewhere on YouTube) and the app actually held up pretty well.
